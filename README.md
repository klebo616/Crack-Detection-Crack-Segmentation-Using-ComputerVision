# Crack-Detection-Crack-Segmentation-Using-ComputerVision
This Github repository has the scope to follow the steps of a successful crack detection with multiple, mainly un-pretrained, models
Focusing on now -> UNet architecture (DoubleConvolution, UpSampling, DownSampling)
                \  Thin 'Haircracks' are not being segmented correctly
                \  Very sensitive to Noise
