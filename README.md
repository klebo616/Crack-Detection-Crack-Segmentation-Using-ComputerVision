# Crack-Detection-Crack-Segmentation-Using-ComputerVision

This GitHub repository has the scope to follow the steps of a successful crack detection with multiple, mainly un-pretrained, models.

**Focusing on now â†’ UNet architecture (DoubleConvolution, UpSampling, DownSampling):**
- Thin *haircracks* are not being segmented correctly  
- Very sensitive to noise
